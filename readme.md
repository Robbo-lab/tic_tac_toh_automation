## Overview

This program allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other on the command line. The game board is displayed after each move, and the players take turns entering their moves until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the `main.py` file using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter row and column numbers to make your moves.
